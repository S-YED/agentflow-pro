# AgentFlow Pro - Video Demonstration Script

## Introduction (30 seconds)
"Hello, I'm presenting AgentFlow Pro - a complete MERN stack application for agent management and CSV list distribution. This project demonstrates all required features including admin authentication, agent management, and automated list distribution."

## Technical Stack Overview (20 seconds)
"The application uses:
- Frontend: Next.js 14 with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Next.js API routes with Node.js
- Database: MongoDB Atlas
- Authentication: JWT tokens
- Deployment: Vercel with live demo at agentflow-pro.vercel.app"

## Feature 1: Admin User Login (45 seconds)
"Let me demonstrate the authentication system:

1. **Login Form**: Shows email and password fields with validation
2. **JWT Authentication**: Enter admin@example.com and admin123
3. **Database Verification**: Credentials are matched against MongoDB user collection
4. **Success Redirect**: On valid login, JWT token is generated and user redirects to dashboard
5. **Error Handling**: Invalid credentials show appropriate error messages

The login uses secure JWT tokens stored in HTTP-only cookies for session management."

## Feature 2: Agent Management (60 seconds)
"Now I'll show the agent creation and management:

1. **Add Agent Form**: Click 'Add Agent' button
2. **Required Fields**: 
   - Name (text validation)
   - Email (email format validation)
   - Mobile with country code (+1234567890 format)
   - Password (minimum length validation)
3. **Form Validation**: All fields are required with proper format checking
4. **Database Storage**: Agent data is saved to MongoDB agents collection
5. **Agent List Display**: All agents are displayed in a responsive table
6. **Delete Functionality**: Remove agents to test different distribution scenarios
7. **Distribution Ready**: System distributes among all available agents

Let me add several agents and then remove some to demonstrate different agent counts."

## Feature 3: CSV Upload and Distribution (90 seconds)
"This is the core feature - CSV upload and equal distribution:

1. **File Upload Validation**: 
   - Only accepts .csv, .xlsx, and .xls files
   - Shows error for invalid file types
   
2. **CSV Format Validation**:
   - Required columns: FirstName, Phone, Notes
   - Sample format shown: John Doe, +1234567890, Important client
   
3. **Upload Process**: Select valid CSV file and click upload
   
4. **Distribution Algorithm**:
   - Items distributed equally among all available agents
   - Base items per agent = totalItems รท totalAgents
   - Remainder items distributed sequentially to first agents
   - Example: 27 items, 5 agents = [6, 6, 5, 5, 5]
   - Example: 20 items, 3 agents = [7, 7, 6]
   
5. **Database Storage**: Distributed lists saved to MongoDB
   
6. **Results Display**: 
   - Shows distribution table with agent names
   - Displays assigned items count for each agent
   - Shows actual distributed data

Let me demonstrate with multiple CSV files:
   - 15 items with 3 agents = [5, 5, 5] (perfect division)
   - 22 items with 4 agents = [6, 6, 5, 5] (remainder handling)
   - 8 items with 2 agents = [4, 4] (small dataset)
   - 31 items with 5 agents = [7, 6, 6, 6, 6] (larger dataset with remainder)"

## Code Quality Demonstration (30 seconds)
"The codebase demonstrates:
- Clean, readable code with TypeScript
- Proper error handling and validation
- Responsive UI with glassmorphism design
- RESTful API endpoints
- Environment variable configuration
- Comprehensive README with setup instructions"

## Live Demo Access (20 seconds)
"The application is deployed live at agentflow-pro.vercel.app with demo credentials provided. The source code is available on GitHub with complete setup instructions and sample data files."

## Conclusion (15 seconds)
"AgentFlow Pro successfully implements all MERN stack requirements with professional UI, robust validation, and automated distribution logic. Thank you for watching this demonstration."

## Demo Flow Checklist:
- [ ] Show login with demo credentials
- [ ] Add 5 agents with validation
- [ ] Upload demo-data-31-items.csv (5 agents, larger dataset)
- [ ] Delete 1 agent, upload demo-data-22-items.csv (4 agents, remainder handling)
- [ ] Delete 1 more agent, upload demo-data-15-items.csv (3 agents, perfect division)
- [ ] Delete 1 more agent, upload demo-data-8-items.csv (2 agents, small dataset)
- [ ] Show responsive design on mobile
- [ ] Highlight error handling
- [ ] Show live deployment

## Key Points to Emphasize:
- Complete MERN stack implementation
- JWT authentication security
- MongoDB data persistence
- Flexible equal distribution algorithm
- Professional UI/UX design
- Comprehensive validation
- Live deployment accessibility
